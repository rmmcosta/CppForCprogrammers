- C++ as a better C
    - oop
    - generic programming
    - both are system implementation languages (SIL)
        - low level
    - for both you have to have a great knowledge of how to deal with memory
- Graph theory
    - shortest path algorithm
    - minimum spanning tree algorithm

c++ is not java but they have similarities
    - the OO methodology for instance
         data and operations belong together
         type extensibility
         the coherent kernel of c++ is c
         type safety

- always favor the standard libraries
- good programmers fulfill community standards, community expectations

- pre-processor commands #define vs const

- c:
    - in the beginning it only supported multi line comments
    - /* */
    - now supports rest line comments as well //
        - this was more c++ style
    - #include
    - <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <time.h>
    - #define macros
    - main()
- c++:
    - // comments
    - #include
    - <iostream>
    - since c is a subset of c++ we can also use c libraries
    - <cstdlib>, <ctime>
    - using of namespaces
        - std is the standard namespace
            - using namespace std;
        - this is equivalent to java packages
        - and to C# namespaces
    - use of const instead of define
    - inline as a new keyword
        - compiler directive
        - inline int sum(int a, int b) {return a+b;}

- c++ improvements:
    - most of these are already present in c as well

- structure of a program:
    - int main(void)
    - cout << "the text we want to print";
    - cin >> variable;
    - and we can use cout and cin directly if in the beginning we said
    that we wanted to use the standard namespace:
        using namespace std;
        - if not, we must use std::cout and std::cin
        - :: is the scope resolution operator
    - << in c this is bit shift
        - in c++ it's only a bit shift when the arguments 
        have that meaning
        - when preceded by an ostream the operator << is overloaded
        
- memory allocation in the stack vs memory allocation in the heap
    - simple variables are allocated in the stack
    - stack is for what you already know (development time)
    - heap is for what you don't know yet (only in runtime)
    - objects are allocated in the heap
        - keyword new
    - heap -> dynamic memory allocation
    - c vs c++
        malloc vs new
        calloc
        realloc
        free vs delete

- C++ supports four types of casting:
    1. Static Cast
        - is a safe cast
        - int x = 3;
        - int y = 2;
        - static_cast<double>(x/y);
    2. Dynamic Cast
    3. Const Cast
    4. Reinterpret Cast

- localization drives down complexity
- endl -> io manipulator
