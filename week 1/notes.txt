    C++ for C Programmers, ch. 2-3

- C++ as a better C
    - oop
    - generic programming
    - both are system implementation languages (SIL)
        - low level
    - for both you have to have a great knowledge of how to deal with memory
- Graph theory
    - shortest path algorithm
    - minimum spanning tree algorithm

c++ is not java but they have similarities
    - the OO methodology for instance
         data and operations belong together
         type extensibility
         the coherent kernel of c++ is c
         type safety
