- The Hex game
    - 7x7
    - blacks, whites and empties
    - one player plays west to east
    - the other player plays north to south
    - the 2nd player can choose to proceed with the first player move
- srand
    - the int rand returns a random number between 0 and max int (RAND_MAX)
    - int rand(void); //cstdlib
    - with srand(time(NULL))
        - with srand we can pass a seed

- inheritance:
    - is a reuse mechanism
    - in c++ uses pure polymorphism
        - uses a virtual function mechanism

- The OOP design methodology:
    1- Decide on a appropriate set of types (classes)
    2- Design in their relatedness(the relationships between classes)
    3- Use inheritance to share code among classes

- public inheritance (90% of the use cases)
    - protected access -> gives access to "family" classes
    class Dog:public Animal
    {
        //the code goes here
    };
