basic min-max algorithm

move semantics (new in c++11)

in c++11 we have <array>
    - is a sequential container class that 
    specifies at compile time a fixed length array
    - high level efficiency of a raw array (c array)
    but also gives you extra functionality

typically move semantics are used for container classes
