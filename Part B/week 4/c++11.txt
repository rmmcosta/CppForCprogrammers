c++11 standard:
    - tuple
    - array
    - forward_list
    - unordered_map, unordered_set
    - thread
    - regex
    - type_traits

with unordered_map, since it's an hashed based map, there are no collisions
and it takes constant time to retrieve a pair.

regex:
    std::regex txt_regex("[a-z]+\\.txt");
    //find a txt file with at least one letter in the name and only letters
    std::regex_match(string,txt_regex);

thread:
    <thread>
    <mutex>
    <future>
    <atomic>
    <condition_variable>
    join is used to synchronize the threads
