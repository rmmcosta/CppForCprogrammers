- Four essential elements of a pattern:
    - pattern name
    - problem
    - solution
    - consequences

- creational patterns:
    - factory method
        - virtual construction
        - defer construction to sub classes
    - singleton
        - assure only one instance
- structural patterns:
    - facade
        - provide unified interface
    - proxy
        - provide surrogate

- factory method:
    - aka: virtual constructor
    - related to abstract factory and prototype patterns
    - code knows about abstract base class (or interface)
    but not concrete subclass
    - creation is deferred to runtime
    - subclasses create objects
    - we have the abstract creator and the concrete creator
        - the concrete creator overrides factory method to build concrete objects
    - supports abstract object interface
    - the abstract creator class has a virtual create method
    - use tags (enumerators) to determine which type is to be created
