c++ 11 features:
    - lambda expressions
        - unnamed functions
    - tuple library
    - threading package
    - regexp package
    - unorder maps
    - move semantics
        - allows high efficiently algorithms
- game of hex
    - monte carlo methods
    - artificial intelligence in game play

- enum class:
    - type safety
    - legacy enums don't provide that
    - we can use other types instead of the underlying default int:
        - enum class Identifier: Integral_Type{enumerator_list};

- stl:
    - three legged stool:
        - containers:
            - sequence:
                - vectors, deques, lists
            - associative:
                - maps, sets
        - iterators
            - pointers or cursors
            - input, random...
        - algorithms
            - numeric
            - sort
            - ...
        - libraries:
            - <regex>
            - <thread>
            - <unordered_map>
            - <array>
            - <forward_list>
- the algorithm find is a single pass algorithm
    - is an example of an input/output iterator
- forward iterator

- Example:
    - poker probability
        - compute the probability in 5 card stud
        of making a straight flush
        - create abstract types for the card
        - use vector and shuffle from stl
- always use the most efficient algorithm and the weakest iterator

- hoare quicksort is the most used algorithm to sort things up
